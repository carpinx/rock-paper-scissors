# Rock Paper Scissors
## JavaScript Game developed for the Foundations course in The Odin Project

Written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, my Rock Paper Scissors project is an attempt to make the project somewhat funny and inclusive.
It has now 4 languages (English, Spanish, Galician and French). **Feel free to contact me to add more languages if you want to**
It has also been tested for colorblind people using colorblind inclusive colors.

I understand the way I organised the files is not the best, but I'm just learning right now, maybe I'll do it better later.
